<title>Data Sharing and Permissions</title>
<definition>Allows user to share objects with desired individuals or groups</definition>
<description>
Users may grant permissions to other members to manipulate or view their objects. A list of all potential users with whom a user may share information is displayed on the left.
This list is divided hierarchically by groups and associated organizations, individual users are situated within groups. On the right side, there are two tabs present "objects" and "dependencies".
The objects tab will be propogated with the object(s) that were selected from the home page, with the intention to share. The dependencies tab will be populated with permission information for any files
that the original object chosen has a dependency to and are necessary for users to properly view the file. For example if an alignment is selected from the home page, the relevant reads and genomes will be populated in the
dependancies list, these are necessary for the user files are being shared with to view the alignment results. To share permissions for the dependencies you must first check the box in front of the file then check the particular 
permissions you wish to share. <br/>
<br/>
The list of users is in a hierarchical structure - all bolded black arrows can be clicked on to display more options. Once group(s)/user(s) with whom you would like to share information
are selected, you can view/edit the objects for which you have allowed them permission as well as the type of permission you wish to
 grant or deny. <br/><br/>

 The options for permission types are: browse, read, download, write, execute, remove, share and administer, all of which have help text directly available
 in the interface. These permissions are available for both the object and dependencies. Users will need to navigate to each tab indivudally to assign permissions to files.
 Check the square next to the desired permission type and choose whether you are allowing or denying permission, whether it is only to selected user(s)/group(s) or a
broader group and to activate or revoke said permission. Once finished, click: Apply.
