<li><u>What is MS-GF+?</u><br>
<br>
<b>MS-GF+: A universal database search tool for proteomics (PMID:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25358478">25358478</a>)<br></b>
<br>
MS-GF+ is a database search tool that identifies both peptides and modified peptides, such as glycosylated peptides, in LC-MS/MS datasets. In addition to identifying more peptides than other MS/MS tools, MS-GF+ is the first tool that functions as a versatile MS/MS database search tool. This is achieved by application of a robust probabilistic model that can search across different spectral datasets. Examples of experimental variables compatible with MS-GF+ include: <br>
<br><ol>
<li>Fragmentation method: Collision-induced dissociation (CID), Electron-transfer dissociation (ETD), Higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD), etc.</li>
<li>Instrument: Low-resolution, High-resolution, Time of flight, etc.</li>
<li>Enzyme: Trypsin, Lys-C, No-enzyme, etc.</li>
<li>Experimental protocol: Standard, Phosphorylation, Glycosylation, etc.</li>
</ol><br>
MS-GF+ indexes large databases using a suffix array, and it includes the patented generating function approach to accurately estimate the E-value of each peptide-spectrum match. It supports a variety of input file formats, including mzML, mzXML, Mascot Generic Files (MGF), MS2 files, Micromass Peak List files (PKL), and Concatenated DTA files (_dta.txt).

<br>
<li><u>Use case scenarios</u><br>
This tool is used for glycopeptide or other PTM identification by searching the proteomics database using an advanced search engine. The power of this tool lies in its ability to analyze data generated by a variety of processing methods.
