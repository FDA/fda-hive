<title>HIVE DNA-insilico</title>
<definition>Generate synthetic data for testing</definition>
<description>

The <span class='toolname'>HIVE DNA-insilico</span> tool generates synthetic reads and recombinants to be used in testing and validation pipelines for various NGS platforms 
and appliances. The user can input genomes of reference organisms, along with specifications for noise, quality, and other attributes, and will return properly formatted <em>in silico</em> 
data in accordance with the user's requests. <br/>
<br/>
To generate either randomized reads or recombinants, the tool requires specification of one or several genome sequences from which to cut the read fragments. The key difference between 
these to services is that the randomizer will return a number of individual "short reads" (in accordance with user input) whereas the recombinant generator will return a single contiguous 
sequence object containing sequence fragments cut from all specified genomes. <br/>
<br/>
Once computation is complete, the newly generated <em>in silico</em> reads or recombinants will appear as objects in the user's home directory. These sequence objects can then be analyzed 
by a number of HIVE NGS tools or exported for validation of external bioinformatics software and pipelines. <br/>

    <li><span class='pn'>Minimum distance</span> - Designate the minimum distance (in bases) between the ends of each pair. Note: this can accommodate overlapping regions.</li>
    <li><span class='pn'>Library length distribution</span> - Choose the overall distribution of lengths to the resulting paired end library: uniform, normal, or Poisson.</li>
    </ul>
<li><span class='pn'>Phred quality score</span></li>

<li><span class='pn'>Output filters</span> - The <em>Low Complexity Filter</em> allows exclusion of any regions of the randomly generated reads or recombinants that are considered to be of low 
    complexity according to their computed Shannon entropy. Select the desired level of strictness from the left dropdown <em>Minimal Shannon Entropy</em> box (corresponding to entropy values) and 
    the number of bases to exclude from the right <em>Window Size</em> dropdown menu.</li>
<li><span class='pn'>Noise</span> - Designate the frequency (as a percent) of <em>Random noise</em> to be included in the output sequence. If including noise, specify the relative ratios of specific single

    from the corresponding drop boxes. Also designate the <em>Start Range</em> and <em>End Range</em> positions of the range from which to generate the results. End range of -1 means there is no 
    limit to the end position (it can be up to the full length of     the genome.) Choose the <em>orientation</em> of the reads to be forward, reverse, complement, or reverse complement. Click the

    generated reads/recombinants. <em>Frequency</em> of occurrence and associated <em>Quality</em> Phred score can also be designated. <em>Allele</em> can be used in cases where the mimicked organism 
    has a ploidy greater than one. The value entered designates the number of copies in which the mutation should appear. (By default, this value is set to 0 meaning the mutation should appear in all 
    copies.) <em>Mutation bias</em> allows designation of a specific position range with respect to the read frame at which the mutation should begin. Click the <img src="img/recAddMore.gif" width=15>
