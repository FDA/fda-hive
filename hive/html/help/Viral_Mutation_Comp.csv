#VIRAL MUTATION COMPARATOR TEMPLATE,,,,,,,,
#This template provides an outline for formatting externally generated mutation call data to be used by the viral mutation comparator tool. ,,,,,,,,
#GENERAL NOTES,,,,,,,,
#All columns are mandatory,,,,,,,,
"#Please enter column headings exactly as they appear below, in the same order as they appear below",,,,,,,,
"#Take care not to add any additional characters (spaces, commas, quotations, etc.) to the column headings",,,,,,,,
"#User may supply additional columns which will be maintained upon update into HIVE, but it is recommended to exclude additional columns as they will be deleted during analysis",,,,,,,,
"#Only columns NGSPL and VISIT may be empty, all other columns must be populated for all data points",,,,,,,,
#Email luis.santana-quintero@fda.hhs.gov or HIVE@fda.hhs.gov with any additional questions,,,,,,,,
#COLUMN DEFINITIONS,,,,,,,,
#USUBJID - clinical trial ID; this field is sortable so please designate a meaningful ID,,,,,,,,
"#NGSPL - platform used to generate next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, for example, Illumina",,,,,,,,
"#VISIT - reason for sample collection, for example, baseline",,,,,,,,
#AAPOS - amino acid position of mutation call ,,,,,,,,
#TCOV - total coverage at the position,,,,,,,,
#AAREF - amino acid at the position in question in the reference genome; please use single letter abbreviation,,,,,,,,
#AASUB - substituted amino acid at the position in the mutant; please use single letter abbreviation,,,,,,,,
#VCOV - coverage of mutant at the position,,,,,,,,
"#AAFREQ - frequency of occurrence of the mutant = VCOV/TCOV, expressed as a decimal",,,,,,,,
#EXAMPLE DATA,,,,,,,,
